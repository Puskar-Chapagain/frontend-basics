how image is stored in the system ?

they are stred in the form of pixels 
- nothing but rows and columns

matrix like calculations 
100 rows * 100 columns >> 10000 pixels

every colour can be created using RGB
in every pixel, value of rgb is stored i.e. color information
and collectively rendered as image

R- 0 to 255
G- 0 to 255
B- 0 to 255 

3 bytes => 24 bits

10K pixels => 10 * 3 bytes = 30bytes
30kb will be the size of image( roughly- there will be other info too)

48 => 16 + 16 + 16
